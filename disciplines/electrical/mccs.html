    <p>NEC Article 100 Definition: An assembly of one or more enclosed sections having a common bus and principally containing motor control units.</p>
    <p>A MCC normally controls most of the motors in a given area of the plant and is located in a centralized location.  A MCC, many times, is also used to feed small transformers, which in turn feed power panels, in the same area as the motors that it powers.  </p>

    <p>The enclosed sections of an MCC are commonly called “cubicles” or “buckets”.  Each “bucket” can contain the following: main breaker or disconnect switch, motor starter, variable frequency drive (VFD), breaker, non-fused disconnect switch, fused disconnect switch, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and metering equipment.  “Buckets” can also contain, mounted to the outside front face, pushbuttons, indicator lights, local power/voltage/current metering, and other control/monitoring devices.  “Buckets” usually contain a 120V or 24V control transformer/power supply.  </p>
    <p>MCCs are used for Low Voltage (50V to 1000V) and Medium Voltage (between 1000V and 35kV) in manufacturing plants, chemical plants, and refineries.  MCCs are commonly used for three-phase loads, and the most common Low Voltage used for MCCs in the U.S. is 480V.  Medium Voltage MCC voltages vary depending on the incoming power to the plant.</p>
    <p>Power and control cables for each load originate from the MCC “bucket” for the given load.  Control cables include local control, such as a hand-off-auto switch, Distributed Control System (DCS) cables, and Safety Instrumented System (SIS) cables.</p>
